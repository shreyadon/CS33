Homework 1

A.

The function is originally supposed to perform a sign extension, but it does not when extracting a byte into a 32-bit int.

B. 

int xbyte(packed_t word, int bytenum)
{
	return (word << ((3 - bytenum) << 3)) >> 24;
}

A. (x<y) == (-x>-y) 
No, this expression will not yield 1 when x = Tmin and y = 0. 

B. ((x+y)<<4) + y-x == 17*y+15*x
Yes, this expression will always yield 1. Due to the Associative, commutative, distributive properties. 

C. ~x+~y+1 == ~(x+y)
Yes, this expression will always yield 1 because of negation. 
~x+~y+1 = (-x-1)+(-y-1)+1 = -(x+y)-1 = ~(x+y)

D. (ux-uy) == -(unsigned)(y-x)
Yes, this expression will always yield 1 because operators act regardless of the status(signed/unsigned) of integers/ 

E. ((x>>2) <<2) <= x
Yes, this expression will always yield 1 because right shifting rounds to minus infinity. Shifting x will cause it to lose value but never gain value.
